# Pretzel Injector for Valorant (Python)

**Pretzel** is a Python-based injector designed for **educational** and **ethical** purposes only. It allows users to experiment with and understand the inner workings of game memory manipulation and code injection techniques. This tool is strictly for learning how to analyze and explore game mechanics, and it should never be used for cheating, exploiting, or disrupting any gaming environment. 

Users are encouraged to only use Pretzel in environments where they have explicit permission, such as personal test environments, to ensure the integrity and fairness of online multiplayer games like Valorant.

> **Important:**  
> The use of any injector or similar tools in a live gaming environment may result in account bans or other disciplinary actions. Always prioritize **ethical behavior** and respect the rules set by game developers.
